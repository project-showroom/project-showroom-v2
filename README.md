This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To install the app, just run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### **Packages used:**

**Next.js:** https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript

**MUI:** https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/

**Material Design Icons:** https://docs.iconify.design/icons/json.html || https://icones.js.org/collection/mdi

**Formik:** https://formik.org/docs/overview => `Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts: Getting values in and out of form state Validation and error messages Handling form submission By colocating all of the above in one place, Formik will keep things organized--making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about your forms a breeze`

**Axios:** https://axios-http.com/docs/intro => `Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.`

**SWR:** https://swr.vercel.app/docs/data-fetching => `The name “SWR” is derived from stale-while-revalidate, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.`

**TailwindCSS:** https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs => `Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It’s completely customizable, but the default configuration is designed to provide a good starting point for most projects.`

**ClassNames:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames => `A simple JavaScript utility for conditionally joining classNames together.`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
